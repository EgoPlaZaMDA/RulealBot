According to our rules (https://oc.tc/rules/) butterfly clicking is highly discouraged as it can lead to double clicking, providing an advantage over other players. As per our rules you must raise your debounce timer to 10ms to prevent this if your mouse is capable of doing so. Iâ€™ll go ahead and reduce your ban to a temporary 30-day ban. I would advise you re-read our rules because if you get banned for anything clicking-related again, your chance of appeal will be very slim.",

Since you admitted and you will follow the rules I will give you a second chance and I will reduce your ban to a temporary 60-day ban. Remember that evading the ban with another account is prohibited and will result in all your accounts being banned. Please read our rules before rejoining the server. (https://oc.tc/rules/)",
    "AC": "Hey @PLAYER thanks for admitting to hacking. Because you promised to stop autoclicking I'll reduce your ban to a temporary 90-day ban. Here are our rules (https://oc.tc/rules/), please read them before you're unbanned so you can be familiar with what will get you banned and what won't, as if you're caught hacking again you will be banned without chance of appeal for a while.",

This is not to say that I don't think you weren't using cheats, just that there isn't enough evidence to uphold this ban. Please read our rules before rejoining the server. (https://oc.tc/rules/)",
